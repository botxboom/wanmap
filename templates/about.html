							<h3>What are Network Ports?</h3>
							<p>Network ports are the communication endpoints for a machine that is connected to the Internet. When a service listens on a port it can receive data from a client application, process it and communicate a response.</p>

							<h3>Nmap host discovery</h3>
							<p>The first phase of a port scan is host discovery. Here the scanner attempts to check if the target host is live before actually probing for open ports. This phase is needed mainly when scanning a large range of IP addresses in order to optimize the time for the whole scan.</p>

							<h3>Open ports detection</h3>
							<p>In order to determine if a TCP port is open, Nmap takes advantage of the Three way handshake mechanism used by TCP to establish a connection between a client and a server.

								There are two main methods for detecting open TCP ports.</p>

What companies are affected by Heartbleed? Shodan provides the tools to answer questions at the Internet-scale.</p>

					<h3>A brief history of Nmap Port Scanner</h3>
					<p>Nmap was first introduced in September 1997 in the article The Art of Scanning, in the well known Phrack Magazine, by its author - Fyodor (Gordon Lyon).

						Since it got a lot of notoriety, Nmap has been referenced in multiple books and it was also used in several artistic movies as a hacking tool (ex. The Matrix).
						
						It has greatly evolved over time (the current version is 7.70) from a simple port scanner to a robust tool containing advanced fingerprinting capabilities and a complex scripting engine. Nmap currently has more than 500 scripts that can run after service detection has been disabled, covering aspects as advanced service discovery, brute-forcing and some vulnerability identification.</p>

						<h3>Network Penetration Testing</h3>
						<i class=" fa fa-rocket" aria-hidden="true"></i>
						<p>Easily scan IP addresses and obtain an aggregated view of the results. The findings are accurate since our servers have direct Internet connection. Furthermore, the scanner is optimized for best performance and quality results.</p>

						<h3>Firewall Rules Verification</h3>
						<i class="fa fa-check-square" aria-hidden="true"></i>
						<p>Check if your firewall was correctly configured and if the servers have unnecessary open TCP ports. By also looking at the service versions, you can find which server software is outdated and needs to be upgraded.</p>

						<h3>Asset Inventory</h3>
						<i class="fa  fa-bell" aria-hidden="true"></i>
						<p>You can easily map the network perimeter of your company and detect live hosts and TCP services exposed to the Internet. Find which machines are old and could be exploited by attackers to break the perimeter and gain access to the internal network.</p>
